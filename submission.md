# Submission Notes

For exercise two the SearchBar.js, MultiSelectDropDown.js, and TwoOptionsSelector are reusable components. ContentControls are a composition of the different controls used just for this application. Content.js had to reference certain attributes from the json response so its use is to display specific data from the database. App.js gets the data for the application.

For exercise two,my code puts the results in alphabetical order like the instructions outline. The picture in the repository for these challenges shows the results unordered

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

I'd add an all button to the radio buttons and implement a switch panel look to the radio buttons. I'd implement Context in React to enable passing data to children a little cleaner. I'd style the dropdown checkboxes more so they have a grey checkmark and a white background.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

Added instructions for the user if their filter combination gave no results. Gave them a suggestion that they may want to clear filters and try again. I added a no image available placeholder when there are bad image links to improve user experience.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
